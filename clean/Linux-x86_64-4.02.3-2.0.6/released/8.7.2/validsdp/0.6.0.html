synopsis: &quot;ValidSDP&quot;
description: &quot;&quot;&quot;
ValidSDP is a library for the Coq formal proof assistant. It provides
reflexive tactics to prove multivariate inequalities involving
real-valued variables and rational constants, using SDP solvers as
untrusted back-ends and verified checkers based on libValidSDP.
Once installed, you can import the following modules:
From Coq Require Import Reals.
From ValidSDP Require Import validsdp.
